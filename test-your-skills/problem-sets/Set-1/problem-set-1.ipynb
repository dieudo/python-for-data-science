    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines are always run on tight schedules and very thin operating margins. To top this, the customers are extremely demanding expecting their flights to be on time always. Airline carriers try to overcome this challenge by detailed planning and prompt execution. However, there are factors like weather, technical glitches, unexpected challenges at airports which end up causing delay in arrival or departure of aircrafts. Since, the flights hop multiple cities any delay caused at one nodal city adds up and results in significant delays in subsequent stoppages if not taken care of early. \n",
